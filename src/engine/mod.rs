///
/// Different implementations offer different characteristics. The library currently ships with
/// a general-purpose [FastPortable] impl that offers good speed and works on any CPU, with more choices
/// coming later, like a constant-time one when side channel resistance is called for, and vendor-specific vectorized ones for more speed.
///
/// See [DEFAULT_ENGINE] if you just want standard base64. Otherwise, when possible, it's
/// recommended to store the engine in a `const` so that references to it won't pose any lifetime
/// issues, and to avoid repeating the cost of engine setup.
// When adding an implementation of Engine, include them in the engine test suite:
// - add an implementation of [engine::tests::EngineWrapper]
// - add the implementation to the `all_engines` macro
// All tests run on all engines listed in the macro.
